            <p style="font-family: 'Poppins';">Religion (from the Latin Religio, meaning 'restraint,' or Relegere,
                according to Cicero, meaning 'to repeat, to read again,' or, most likely, Religionem, 'to show respect
                for what is sacred') is an organized system of beliefs and practices revolving around, or leading to, a
                transcendent spiritual experience. There is no culture recorded in human history which has not practiced
                some form of religion. <BR></BR>
                In ancient times, religion was indistinguishable from what is known as 'mythology' in the present day
                and consisted of regular rituals based on a belief in higher supernatural entities who created and
                continued to maintain the world and surrounding cosmos. Ancient people felt that no single God could
                possibly take care of all the needs of an individual.

                    with each other without coming into conflict. <BR></BR>
                    Many religions have developed in parallel and in harmony in China for thousands of
                    years. The most important reason is that all Chinese religions embrace the culture of harmony. We
                    know
                    that the flourishing of one means the flourishing of all and the demise of one the demise of all.
                    Therefore,
                    we accommodate and look out for each other.

                    Different religions need to learn to respect each other. Like people, religions also need
                    to show due respect to each other. When you threaten to burn the scriptures of another religion, you
                    are
                    lighting the flame of hatred and conflict. Without respect, dialogue and exchanges will be
                    difficult.
                    Without dialogue and exchanges, there will be no understanding or cooperation to speak of.

                    Religions prove

                    social

                    issues and
                    shows a particular complexity. In the past and at present, there have always been groups and

                    who seek to exploit faith for dark purposes. A country may use religion to interfere in the internal

                    of another. <BR></BR>
                    A group may engage in activities aimed at sabotaging national unity and territorial integrity
                    under the pretext of religion. An individual may undermine others’ rights and social stability under
                    the
                    banner of religion. All these behaviors not only discredit faith but also harm public interests. All
